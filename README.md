### Rating

This extension uses factual rating classifications sourced from [mediabiasfactcheck.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/). Ratings are transformed and mapped to numeric scales, and are not endorsed by MBFC.

Numeric scoring is my own interpretation of MBFC’s publicly available rating categories:
